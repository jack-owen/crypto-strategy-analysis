# Intro

An API project, to use the https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-api and generate useful insight for crypto coins and my personal portfolios.
\n

I wanted to understand how effective different static bitcoin
investment strategies would have been against historic bitcoin prices,
static being what if I was to purchase \$100 of coin on the first of
every month, how effective would this strategy be? As opposed to
manually trying to time the market to optimise portfolio value.
\n
I understand this task could have been done far more quickly using
excel compared to learning to use React and revisitng JS, however I
wanted to challenge myself to learn a new framework.
\n
The goal for this project as always for me is to revist and look at how code can be refactored to produce efficient and easy to understand code. Even the most complex of functions can be refactored into simple logic statements (most of the time).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
